# HOMEWORK 1: Code Refactor

## Updates
The HTML has been updated with new semantic elements. A broken link in the nav was repaired. Descriptions have been added to all images and figures for improved accesibility. The CSS has been substantially shortened for improved efficiency. Sections in both the HTML and CSS have been labeled with comments.
